# Project State

## Purpose

This is the live state file for QuantLab.

Use this file to answer:
- where we are now
- what is currently active
- what the next task is
- what is blocked
- what was just completed

This file must stay short and current.

---

## Current snapshot

- current_phase: `Phase 5 core training loop exists, but production-surface readiness and remaining evaluation-discipline gaps are still open`
- current_focus: `Interpretation guardrail hardening completed: precedence, temporary-path limits, and task path classification are now explicit, while temporary drifts remain visible instead of reading like direction`
- current_blocker: `none`
- declared_next_task: `Decide and track walk-forward fold consumption first, then add the production observation preset and explicit exit tracking for the NumPy trainer drift and legacy compat window`
- not_now:
  - `live deployment plumbing`
  - `reward_v2 path-aware redesign`
  - `advanced selector heuristics`

## Active work item

```yaml
id: interpretation-guardrail-hardening
title: Harden repo interpretation so temporary, optional, and allowed paths are harder to misread as core direction
status: done
```

## Current blocker details

None. Verification gates for the governance hardening batch are clean:
- `.venv/bin/ruff check .` → All checks passed!
- `.venv/bin/mypy src` → Success: no issues found in 42 source files
- `.venv/bin/pytest` → 96 passed
- `git diff --check` → clean

## Recently completed

- constitutional layer written
- canonical contract docs written
- runtime/executor boundary written
- operational repo-memory layer added
- QL-001 gap audit completed
- confirmed split_v1 and reward_v1 mismatches recorded in BACKLOG
- no confirmed observation blocker was found from current audit evidence
- QL-002 split_v1 alignment completed
- canonical train/validation/final untouched test segmentation now exists with persisted split artifacts and walk-forward folds
- QL-007 minimum turnover-event dependency was resolved inside the reward path without a broader action-space epic
- QL-003 reward_v1 parity alignment completed
- effective selected-venue semantics are now explicit in reward context during reward application and evaluation
- QL-005 policy artifact metadata and execution intent path alignment completed
- policy artifacts now carry canonical runtime metadata and compatibility tags, and runtime selector output can be materialized as explicit execution intent
- QL-006 registry schema and promotion-gate enforcement completed
- registry now records auditable promotion decisions and prevents automatic score-only champion promotion
- Phase 4 paper/sim evidence operationalization completed
- paper/sim evidence is now attached as a first-class registry-linked record, and promotion decisions can link evaluation, comparison, paper/sim, and deployment evidence without ad-hoc placeholders
- QL-008 real training loop implementation completed
- the active training path now fits learned policy weights, records search-budget metadata, and selects checkpoints on validation without touching the final untouched test
- QL-009 candidate search expansion and repo-wide verification gate cleanup completed
- explicit candidate_search configs now produce multiple learned candidates; repo-wide ruff/mypy/pytest/diff-check verification gate is now fully clean
- Remediation Batch 1 verification completed; audit findings are now classified in `docs/REMEDIATION_BATCH_1.md`
- secret hygiene guardrails now include `.env.example` plus stricter `.gitignore` coverage; current repo inspection found no `.env` path tracked in git history, but local secret rotation remains an external action if those credentials are live
- NumPy-vs-PyTorch trainer drift is now recorded explicitly in `docs/DECISIONS.md` without changing the constitutional PyTorch target
- lightweight structured logging now covers trajectory building, training search, and registry mutations
- the active shared feature extractor now includes derived-surface channels, closing the confirmed Batch 1 observation-path gap
- `MomentumBaselineTrainer` is no longer a silent alias; it remains import-compatible through a deprecated shim
- Remediation Batch 2 completed; new artifacts now embed a strict runtime contract and runtime rejects scale-spec, raw-shape, derived-contract, derived-channel, feature-dimension, and deprecated-adapter mismatches before inference
- a temporary legacy compat window now exists only for deterministic legacy `linear-policy-v1` artifacts; legacy acceptance is explicit, logged, and deprecated rather than silent
- deprecated `momentum-baseline-v1` artifacts are now quarantined from the normal runtime path and rejected with an explicit retrain/re-export message
- Batch 2 verification and patch notes are recorded in `docs/REMEDIATION_BATCH_2.md`
- interpretation precedence is now explicit in `AGENTS.md`; allowed, optional, and temporary paths are no longer left to implicit reading
- `docs/TASK_TEMPLATE.md` now requires path classification before implementation so temporary or optional paths are harder to grow accidentally
- D-011 now behaves as an active guardrail instead of a passive note: NumPy is continuity-only and not a strategic growth path
- derived surface is now documented as augmentation only; support for derived channels no longer implies a core/default requirement
- legacy compat is now documented as a retirement-tracked continuity tool, not a development magnet

## Immediate next actions

1. Decide whether walk-forward fold consumption should become a dedicated training backlog item and execute it under explicit backlog tracking.
2. Add the production observation preset/config instead of letting the smoke/fixture preset read like the default future surface.
3. Track exit criteria for the temporary NumPy trainer drift and legacy compat window rather than allowing them to linger as implied defaults.

## Update rule

After every meaningful task:
- update `current_focus` if it changed
- update `declared_next_task`
- update `Recently completed`
- update the active work item or replace it
